# C++ Netflix Movie Replica
This project is made to store movie data using a linked list data structure. It is made to resemble Netflix's movie list.
<p align="justify">
To create this I used pointers and a linked list data structure. The user will be prompted with a list of options they may perform on the database using
the multiple methods I created. These methods allow manipulation of the data in various ways. The program makes an efficient network of nodes to store the movie data.

What the program allows the user to do:
 - Add a **_new node_**
 - Add a **_new node_** in a specific location
 - Display all items in the list
 - Find a **_node_** by its ID
 - Delete a **_node_** by its ID
 - Delete all items in the list
 - Sort the list alphabetically
 - Save to a **_txt file_**
 - Load from a **_txt file_**
 - Check if list is empty
